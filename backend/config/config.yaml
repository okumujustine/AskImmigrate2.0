      Use this systematic approach to provide your response:
      1. Break down the problem into smaller steps
      2. Address each step systematically
      3. Show your reasoning for each step
      4. Then provide your final conclusion

    ReAct: |
      Use this systematic approach to provide your response:
      1. Thought: What approaches could I take to solve this?
      2. Action: Choose and implement the best approach
      3. Observation: What happened? What did I learn?
      4. Reflection: Do I have enough information to provide my final answer, or should I try a different approach?

      (Repeat steps 1–4 as needed)

      Then provide your final answer.

    Self-Ask: |
      Use this systematic approach to provide your response:
      1. Break the main question into smaller sub-questions.
      2. Answer each sub-question thoroughly.
      3. Then, based on those answers, synthesize a clear and thoughtful final response.
